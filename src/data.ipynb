       "      <td>The doctrine of priest–penitent privilege does not apply in England. However, before the Reformation, England was a Roman Catholic country and the Seal of the Confessional had great authority in the English courts.\\n\\nAnglo-Saxon England\\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there several laws concerning confession. The laws of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, enjoin:\\n\\nThis injunction is repeated in the forty-fourth of the secular laws of King Canute. These laws are prefaced thus: \"This then is the secular law which by the counsel of my witan I will that it be observed all over England\".\\n\\nThe laws of King Ethelred the Unready declare (V, 22):\\n\\nThe very close connexion between the religion of the Anglo-Saxons and their laws, many of which are purely ordinances of religious observance enacted by the state, the repeated recognition of the supreme jurisdiction of the Pope, and the various instances of the application in the Church in England of the laws of the Church in general lead to the opinion that the ecclesiastical law of the secrecy of confession was recognized by the law of the land in Anglo-Saxon England.\\n\\nAfter the Norman Conquest\\nIn the period between the Norman Conquest and the Reformation the law of the Church in general, as to the inviolability of the seal of confession, is stringently enjoined by English councils. The Council of Durham (1220) declared as follows:\\n\\nThe Provincial Council of Oxford, held in 1222, contains a similar canon, in which degradation is prescribed for any breach of the seal. The law, as laid down by the 21st canon of the Lateran Council, is also declared in the Acts of the Synod of Exeter in 1287 (Spelman, Concilia, II, 357).\\n\\nThe fact that the laws of the Church were so emphatic on the subject, coupled with the fact that the Church was then the Church of the nation, affords good ground for inferring that the secular courts recognized the seal. The recognition of it would not have rested on any principle of immunity from disclosure of confidential communications made to clergymen. It would have rested on the fact that confession was a sacrament, on the fact of that necessity for it which the doctrine of the Church laid down, on the fact of the practice of it by both king and people, and on the fact that the practice was wholly a matter of spiritual discipline and one, moreover, in regard to which the Church had so definitely declared the law of absolute secrecy.\\n\\nIt is stated by some, among others by the Commissioners appointed to report upon the ecclesiastical courts in their report published in 1883, that the ecclesiastical courts in England did not regard themselves as bound by the rules of canon law framed by the Church outside England, by the various papal decrees, rescripts etc. But the Commissioners add that these courts paid great respect and attention to these rules, decrees etc. There seems to be so much weighty evidence against this view that it is difficult to accept it. Sir Frederick Pollock and Professor Frederic William Maitland in their joint History of English Law (I, 94 and 95) say that the jus commune or common law of the universal Church was the law of the Church in England. In this connexion important material is contained in the Provinciale of William Lyndwood (Oxford, 1679), arguably the only great English canonist.\\n\\nThe Provinciale\\nThe Provinciale consists of the provincial constitutions of fourteen Archbishops of Canterbury from Stephen Langton (d. 1228) to Henry Chichele (d. 1443). When Lyndwood was engaged on this compilation he was the principal official of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been, also, the prolocutor of the clergy in the Convocation of Canterbury.\\n\\nMaitland, in his essays on Roman Canon Law in the Church of England, expresses the opinion that the ecclesiastical courts in England regarded the general body of canon law, including the various papal decrees and rescripts and the commentaries of the various great writers, as their law, which they had to administer. In citing Lyndwood as providing grounds for this opinion Maitland says: \"At any rate he will state the law which he administers in the chief of all the English ecclesiastical courts\".\\n\\nIn the Provinciale there is a constitution of \"Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury\", apparently Walter Reynolds, transferred from the See of Worcester in 1313. The constitution begins with a prohibition to priests who have fallen into mortal sin to say mass without first going to confession and warning them against imagining, as some believers erroneously do, that mortal sins are forgiven by the general confession made in the recitation of the Confiteor. It continues as follows:\\n\\nLyndwood on confession\\nLyndwood gives the following commentary on  Walter Reynolds' constitution,  occurring upon the word \"Confession\":\\n\\nDealing with the priest's being found guilty of revealing a confession, he says:\\n\\nHe states that Henry de Bohic:\\n\\nLyndwood then continues as follows:\\n\\nUpon the word \"generaliter\" there is the following comment:\\n\\nHe cites Hostiensis in support. It is to be observed that there is nowhere an exception in respect of the crime of treason. His commentary on the duty of not disclosing the confession of a crime proposed to be committed tends to show that he would not have recognized any such exception.\\n\\nPupilla oculi\\nA manual, called Pupilla oculi (see Gasquet, Pre-Reformation Essays), which appears to have been mainly designed for practical use among the clergy, was compiled towards the end of the fourteenth century by John de Burgh, a professor of theology and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. According to Edward Badeley who wrote in 1865 a most able pamphlet on the privilege of the seal of confession entitled The Privilege of Religious Confessions in English Courts of Justice, this manual, to which Maitland also refers, enjoyed great popularity.

       "      <td>The doctrine of priest–penitent privilege does not apply in England. However, before the Reformation, England was a Roman Catholic country and the Seal of the Confessional had great authority in the English courts.\\n\\nAnglo-Saxon England\\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there several laws concerning confession. The laws of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, enjoin:\\n\\nThis injunction is repeated in the forty-fourth of the secular laws of King Canute. These laws are prefaced thus: \"This then is the secular law which by the counsel of my witan I will that it be observed all over England\".\\n\\nThe laws of King Ethelred the Unready declare (V, 22):\\n\\nThe very close connexion between the religion of the Anglo-Saxons and their laws, many of which are purely ordinances of religious observance enacted by the state, the repeated recognition of the supreme jurisdiction of the Pope, and the various instances of the application in the Church in England of the laws of the Church in general lead to the opinion that the ecclesiastical law of the secrecy of confession was recognized by the law of the land in Anglo-Saxon England.\\n\\nAfter the Norman Conquest\\nIn the period between the Norman Conquest and the Reformation the law of the Church in general, as to the inviolability of the seal of confession, is stringently enjoined by English councils. The Council of Raleigh (1220) declared as follows:\\n\\nThe Provincial Council of Oxford, held in 1222, contains a similar canon, in which degradation is prescribed for any breach of the seal. The law, as laid down by the 21st canon of the Lateran Council, is also declared in the Acts of the Synod of Exeter in 1287 (Spelman, Concilia, II, 357).\\n\\nThe fact that the laws of the Church were so emphatic on the subject, coupled with the fact that the Church was then the Church of the nation, affords good ground for inferring that the secular courts recognized the seal. The recognition of it would not have rested on any principle of immunity from disclosure of confidential communications made to clergymen. It would have rested on the fact that confession was a sacrament, on the fact of that necessity for it which the doctrine of the Church laid down, on the fact of the practice of it by both king and people, and on the fact that the practice was wholly a matter of spiritual discipline and one, moreover, in regard to which the Church had so definitely declared the law of absolute secrecy.\\n\\nIt is stated by some, among others by the Commissioners appointed to report upon the ecclesiastical courts in their report published in 1883, that the ecclesiastical courts in England did not regard themselves as bound by the rules of canon law framed by the Church outside England, by the various papal decrees, rescripts etc. But the Commissioners add that these courts paid great respect and attention to these rules, decrees etc. There seems to be so much weighty evidence against this view that it is difficult to accept it. Sir Frederick Pollock and Professor Frederic William Maitland in their joint History of English Law (I, 94 and 95) say that the jus commune or common law of the universal Church was the law of the Church in England. In this connexion important material is contained in the Provinciale of William Lyndwood (Oxford, 1679), arguably the only great English canonist.\\n\\nThe Provinciale\\nThe Provinciale consists of the provincial constitutions of fourteen Archbishops of Canterbury from Stephen Langton (d. 1228) to Henry Chichele (d. 1443). When Lyndwood was engaged on this compilation he was the principal official of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been, also, the prolocutor of the clergy in the Convocation of Canterbury.\\n\\nMaitland, in his essays on Roman Canon Law in the Church of England, expresses the opinion that the ecclesiastical courts in England regarded the general body of canon law, including the various papal decrees and rescripts and the commentaries of the various great writers, as their law, which they had to administer. In citing Lyndwood as providing grounds for this opinion Maitland says: \"At any rate he will state the law which he administers in the chief of all the English ecclesiastical courts\".\\n\\nIn the Provinciale there is a constitution of \"Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury\", apparently Walter Reynolds, transferred from the See of Worcester in 1313. The constitution begins with a prohibition to priests who have fallen into mortal sin to say mass without first going to confession and warning them against imagining, as some believers erroneously do, that mortal sins are forgiven by the general confession made in the recitation of the Confiteor. It continues as follows:\\n\\nLyndwood on confession\\nLyndwood gives the following commentary on  Walter Reynolds' constitution,  occurring upon the word \"Confession\":\\n\\nDealing with the priest's being found guilty of revealing a confession, he says:\\n\\nHe states that Henry de Bohic:\\n\\nLyndwood then continues as follows:\\n\\nUpon the word \"generaliter\" there is the following comment:\\n\\nHe cites Hostiensis in support. It is to be observed that there is nowhere an exception in respect of the crime of treason. His commentary on the duty of not disclosing the confession of a crime proposed to be committed tends to show that he would not have recognized any such exception.\\n\\nPupilla oculi\\nA manual, called Pupilla oculi (see Gasquet, Pre-Reformation Essays), which appears to have been mainly designed for practical use among the clergy, was compiled towards the end of the fourteenth century by John de Burgh, a professor of theology and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. According to Edward Badeley who wrote in 1865 a most able pamphlet on the privilege of the seal of confession entitled The Privilege of Religious Confessions in English Courts of Justice, this manual, to which Maitland also refers, enjoyed great popularity. Its counsels to confessors who may happen to be witnesses in a court of justice are sufficiently like those already cited from Lyndwood's Provinciale to render it unnecessary to quote them.\\n\\nAnalysis from the Catholic Encyclopedia\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia provides the following analysis:\\n\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia goes on to quote Maitland on what it regards as \"remarkable evidence of the acceptance of the decrees of the Council of Lateran in England\". Speaking of trial by ordeal he says:\\n\\nThe order, thereupon, proceeds to suggest certain rules for the judges to follow.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nAttribution\\n\\nCanon law history\\nHistory of Catholicism in England\\nLegal history of England\\nPriest–penitent privilege in England\\nMedieval English law\\nChristianity in medieval England</td>\n",

It consisted of a spring chamber, in which the water from various springs collected, and three accessible galleries into which the water was directed downwards at a slight gradient to the castle well or to two other wells in the residential area. The latter two, the \"Upper Well\" and the \"Deer Well\", were destroyed after 1965, the tunnel to the castle well, which has been preserved over a length of 300 m, is now called the \"Well Tunnel\" and is one of the cultural monuments of the municipality.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe house was built in 1767 by the architect, Sigmund Jacob Haeckher, and called Maison de la Campagne (\"Country House\"). Its owner was Franz Karl Freiherr von Hacke and his wife, Amönia Freiin von Sturmfeder. He was the master hunter (Obristjägermeister) of Electoral Palatine, responsible for hunting in the 55 km2 Barony of Wilenstein. The first lightning conductor in the Palatinate was installed at the house on 17 April 1776 by physicist, Johann Jakob Hemmer, from Mannheim.

sponsoring reasons) was the fifty-first season since its establishment. It began on 22 August 2008 and ended on 31 May 2009. Galatasaray were the defending champions.\\n\\nBeşiktaş clinched the championship after winning at Denizlispor on the last matchday. The latter barely avoided relegation after finishing in a three-way tie on points with Gençlerbirliği and Konyaspor. Head-to-head comparison between those three teams eventually resulted in the demotion of Konyaspor, who joined Kocaelispor and Hacettepe on their way to the second-level First League.\\n\\nFenerbahçe and Galatasaray had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, after Sivasspor came in as runners-up and Trabzonspor finished third. The final positions for the three Istanbul clubs marked the first time since the 1980–81 season that only one of them was able to finish among the top three teams in Turkish football.\\n\\nPromotion and relegation from 2007–08\\nÇaykur Rizespor, Manisaspor and Kasımpaşa were relegated at the end of the 2007–08 season after finishing on the bottom three places of the standings. They were replaced by TFF First League champions Kocaelispor, runners-up Antalyaspor and play-off winners Eskişehirspor.\\n\\nTeam overview\\n\\nNotes\\n Kayserispor played their 2008 home matches at Kayseri Atatürk Stadium.

It is a key maritime institution under the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China, and is a Chinese state Double First Class University Plan university identified by the Ministry of Education.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe long history of the university can be traced back to 1909, when the Nanyang Institute in Shanghai established a Shipping Management Section.  DMU was founded in 1953 through the merger of three merchant marine institutions: Shanghai Nautical College, the Northeast Navigation College and Fujian Navigation School. At the time its name was Dalian Marine College, and it was the only maritime college in China. In 1960, DMU was designated a national key institution of higher education. Later in 1983, the Asia-Pacific Region Maritime Training Center was established at DMU by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the IMO, and in 1985, a branch of the World Maritime University (WMU) was established.\\n\\nIn 1994 the university's name was changed to the present one.\\n\\nOn June 6, 2009, DMU celebrated its centennial, with vice chairman of standing committee of 11th National People's Congress Chen Zhili as the main guest.\\n\\nFacilities \\nDMU is located in southwestern Dalian. The university covers an area of 1.13 million square meters with about half a million square meters occupied by buildings. DMU has a training dock and over 40 laboratories for teaching, training and research. DMU also owns and operates an ocean-going training vessel of over 10,000 deadweight tonnage.\\n\\nAcademics \\nThe university is designated as one of the \"Project 211\" institutions.

Wesleyan Methodist minister, who for a period supervised Wesleyan missionaries in the Madras Presidency of the British Raj.\\n\\nLife\\nHe was born at St. Austell, Cornwall, on 31 July 1794; his father, Timothy Crowther, and his uncles Jonathan Crowther (1760–1824) and Richard, were Methodist preachers appointed by John Wesley. He was educated at Kingswood School, then in Gloucestershire, and began to preach aged about 20.\\n\\nHaving been principal teacher at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford, Yorkshire, Crowther was appointed in 1823 headmaster of Kingswood School. He was removed from his position there in 1826, because of a brutal use of corporal punishment. One of his pupils was Christopher Walton. After this he was moved between Wesleyan circuits.\\n\\nIn 1837 Crowther was appointed general superintendent of the Wesleyan missions in India, returning to England in 1843 in poor health, where he was again employed in the home ministry. In 1849 he received the appointment of classical tutor in the Wesleyan Theological Institution at Didsbury, in Lancashire.\\n\\nAs a scholar, Crowther had a knowledge of Hebrew and several modern languages. He acted as examiner at Wesley College, Sheffield, as well as at the New Kingswood and Woodhouse Grove schools, and wrote for Wesleyan periodicals. His health failed some time before his death, and on 31 December 1855 he was seized with \"congestion of the brain\" while on a visit to the Rev. William Willan in Leeds. In this friend's house he died on 16 January 1856, leaving a widow and family.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nExternal links\\nAttribution\\n\\n1794 births\\n1856 deaths\\nEnglish Methodist ministers\\nPeople from St Austell\\n19th-century Methodist ministers   \n",
       "4    The doctrine of priest–penitent privilege does not apply in England. However, before the Reformation, England was a Roman Catholic country and the Seal of the Confessional had great authority in the English courts.\\n\\nAnglo-Saxon England\\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there several laws concerning confession. The laws of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, enjoin:\\n\\nThis injunction is repeated in the forty-fourth of the secular laws of King Canute. These laws are prefaced thus: \"This then is the secular law which by the counsel of my witan I will that it be observed all over England\".\\n\\nThe laws of King Ethelred the Unready declare (V, 22):\\n\\nThe very close connexion between the religion of the Anglo-Saxons and their laws, many of which are purely ordinances of religious observance enacted by the state, the repeated recognition of the supreme jurisdiction of the Pope, and the various instances of the application in the Church in England of the laws of the Church in general lead to the opinion that the ecclesiastical law of the secrecy of confession was recognized by the law of the land in Anglo-Saxon England.\\n\\nAfter the Norman Conquest\\nIn the period between the Norman Conquest and the Reformation the law of the Church in general, as to the inviolability of the seal of confession, is stringently enjoined by English councils. The Council of Durham (1220) declared as follows:\\n\\nThe Provincial Council of Oxford, held in 1222, contains a similar canon, in which degradation is prescribed for any breach of the seal. The law, as laid down by the 21st canon of the Lateran Council, is also declared in the Acts of the Synod of Exeter in 1287 (Spelman, Concilia, II, 357).\\n\\nThe fact that the laws of the Church were so emphatic on the subject, coupled with the fact that the Church was then the Church of the nation, affords good ground for inferring that the secular courts recognized the seal. The recognition of it would not have rested on any principle of immunity from disclosure of confidential communications made to clergymen. It would have rested on the fact that confession was a sacrament, on the fact of that necessity for it which the doctrine of the Church laid down, on the fact of the practice of it by both king and people, and on the fact that the practice was wholly a matter of spiritual discipline and one, moreover, in regard to which the Church had so definitely declared the law of absolute secrecy.\\n\\nIt is stated by some, among others by the Commissioners appointed to report upon the ecclesiastical courts in their report published in 1883, that the ecclesiastical courts in England did not regard themselves as bound by the rules of canon law framed by the Church outside England, by the various papal decrees, rescripts etc. But the Commissioners add that these courts paid great respect and attention to these rules, decrees etc. There seems to be so much weighty evidence against this view that it is difficult to accept it. Sir Frederick Pollock and Professor Frederic William Maitland in their joint History of English Law (I, 94 and 95) say that the jus commune or common law of the universal Church was the law of the Church in England. In this connexion important material is contained in the Provinciale of William Lyndwood (Oxford, 1679), arguably the only great English canonist.\\n\\nThe Provinciale\\nThe Provinciale consists of the provincial constitutions of fourteen Archbishops of Canterbury from Stephen Langton (d. 1228) to Henry Chichele (d. 1443). When Lyndwood was engaged on this compilation he was the principal official of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been, also, the prolocutor of the clergy in the Convocation of Canterbury.\\n\\nMaitland, in his essays on Roman Canon Law in the Church of England, expresses the opinion that the ecclesiastical courts in England regarded the general body of canon law, including the various papal decrees and rescripts and the commentaries of the various great writers, as their law, which they had to administer. In citing Lyndwood as providing grounds for this opinion Maitland says: \"At any rate he will state the law which he administers in the chief of all the English ecclesiastical courts\".\\n\\nIn the Provinciale there is a constitution of \"Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury\", apparently Walter Reynolds, transferred from the See of Worcester in 1313. The constitution begins with a prohibition to priests who have fallen into mortal sin to say mass without first going to confession and warning them against imagining, as some believers erroneously do, that mortal sins are forgiven by the general confession made in the recitation of the Confiteor. It continues as follows:\\n\\nLyndwood on confession\\nLyndwood gives the following commentary on  Walter Reynolds' constitution,  occurring upon the word \"Confession\":\\n\\nDealing with the priest's being found guilty of revealing a confession, he says:\\n\\nHe states that Henry de Bohic:\\n\\nLyndwood then continues as follows:\\n\\nUpon the word \"generaliter\" there is the following comment:\\n\\nHe cites Hostiensis in support. It is to be observed that there is nowhere an exception in respect of the crime of treason. His commentary on the duty of not disclosing the confession of a crime proposed to be committed tends to show that he would not have recognized any such exception.\\n\\nPupilla oculi\\nA manual, called Pupilla oculi (see Gasquet, Pre-Reformation Essays), which appears to have been mainly designed for practical use among the clergy, was compiled towards the end of the fourteenth century by John de Burgh, a professor of theology and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. According to Edward Badeley who wrote in 1865 a most able pamphlet on the privilege of the seal of confession entitled The Privilege of Religious Confessions in English Courts of Justice, this manual, to which Maitland also refers, enjoyed great popularity. Its counsels to confessors who may happen to be witnesses in a court of justice are sufficiently like those already cited from Lyndwood's Provinciale to render it unnecessary to quote them.\\n\\nAnalysis from the Catholic Encyclopedia\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia provides the following analysis:\\n\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia goes on to quote Maitland on what it regards as \"remarkable evidence of the acceptance of the decrees of the Council of Lateran in England\". Speaking of trial by ordeal he says:\\n\\nThe order, thereupon, proceeds to suggest certain rules for the judges to follow.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nAttribution\\n\\nCanon law history\\nHistory of Catholicism in England\\nLegal history of England\\nPriest–penitent privilege in England\\nMedieval English law\\nChristianity in medieval England   \n",

                                       Xtreme Swing is a thrill ride located at Valleyfair in Shakopee, Minnesota.\\n\\nSpecifications \\nXtreme Swing is a Screamin' Swing type ride built by S&S Worldwide.  The structure itself is  tall at its highest point, the equivalent height of a ten-story building, making it the world's second largest swinging thrill ride, Skyhawk at Cedar Point being the largest. It consists of two swinging arms, both  tall, seating 20 across and 20 back to back (40 total). At full swing, the ends of the arms approach  high off the ground—as high as a twelve-story building—and achieve a maximum velocity of 60 miles-per-hour—faster than most wooden roller coasters. The ride lasts about one minute, and can accommodate 800 passengers per hour. Riders must be  or taller. Riders are restrained by a lap bar.\\n\\nSee also\\n Skyhawk, a similar ride that opened at Cedar Point the same year\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nOfficial page\\n\\nAmusement rides manufactured by S&S – Sansei Technologies\\nValleyfair\\nAmusement rides introduced in 2006\\nCedar Fair attractions   \n",

It has one basement and two storeys. Above the entrance is a relief of the coat of arms of the Hacke and Sturmfeder alliance.\\n\\nThe gable above the front entrance shows a relief, the date 1766 and the names or the arms of alliance of its first owners, Franz Karl Joseph von Hacke (son of Ludwig Anton von Hacke) and Amöna Marie Charlotte Juliane Sturmfeder von Oppenweiler, who was a daughter of local Dirmstein nobleman, Marsilius Franz Sturmfeder von Oppenweiler.\\n\\nIn 1767, an underground water supply was built at the Quellbachhübel, northeast of the residential buildings. It consisted of a spring chamber, in which the water from various springs collected, and three accessible galleries into which the water was directed downwards at a slight gradient to the castle well or to two other wells in the residential area. The latter two, the \"Upper Well\" and the \"Deer Well\", were destroyed after 1965, the tunnel to the castle well, which has been preserved over a length of 300 m, is now called the \"Well Tunnel\" and is one of the cultural monuments of the municipality.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe house was built in 1767 by the architect, Sigmund Jacob Haeckher, and called Maison de la Campagne (\"Country House\"). Its owner was Franz Karl Freiherr von Hacke and his wife, Amönia Freiin von Sturmfeder. He was the master hunter (Obristjägermeister) of Electoral Palatine, responsible for hunting in the 55 km2 Barony of Wilenstein. The first lightning conductor in the Palatinate was installed at the house on 17 April 1776 by physicist, Johann Jakob Hemmer, from Mannheim. Its French garden was planned and executed around 1780 by landscape architect, Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who was also responsible for its natural extension, the attractive valley of Karlstal through which the Moosalb stream flows.\\n\\nFrench Revolutionary troops partly destroyed the house on 13 July 1794, leaving only the cellars inhabitable. The house went into Alsatian possession in 1803. The entire manorial estate of Trippstadt, including the house, was sold in 1833 by Reichsrat, Ludwig von Gienanth.\\n\\nIn 1865, the Freiherr von Gienanth sold the house to the Kingdom of Bavaria. They established a state forestry office there in 1885 and, in 1888, rebuilt the ruined part of the house. A forestry school was opened in the house. In 1915, during the First World War, the school had to be closed. Not until 1946, after the Second World War, was it re-opened as a school of forestry for the Palatinate.\\n\\nThe house was home to the Rhineland-Palatinate State School of Forestry from 1960 to 1980. In 1985, the municipality of Trippstadt took over the management of the gardens and turned them into a recreation area. In 1987, the house became the home of the Forest Research Institute of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nLiterature \\n Günter Stein: Burgen und Schlösser in der Pfalz.

Gananoque Airport  is located  northwest of the town of Gananoque, Ontario, Canada, in Canada's busy Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. It is currently a major centre for skydiving, as well as one of the three Canadian airports serving the Thousand Islands (along with Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport and Brockville Regional Tackaberry Airport).\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Gananoque Airport was a relief landing field for RCAF Station Kingston (now Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport) during World War II, and with Kingston, participated in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The field preserves the original, classic BCATP triangular runway arrangement along with some of the original wartime structures.\\n\\nSince 1971, the airport has been utilized as a sports skydiving dropzone with jumps available to the general public.\\n\\nSee also\\n Gananoque Water Aerodrome\\n RCAF Detachment Gananoque\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Page about this airport on COPA's Places to Fly airport directory\\n Skydive Gananoque\\n\\nRegistered aerodromes in Ontario\\nAirports of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan   \n",

sponsoring reasons) was the fifty-first season since its establishment. It began on 22 August 2008 and ended on 31 May 2009. Galatasaray were the defending champions.\\n\\nBeşiktaş clinched the championship after winning at Denizlispor on the last matchday. The latter barely avoided relegation after finishing in a three-way tie on points with Gençlerbirliği and Konyaspor. Head-to-head comparison between those three teams eventually resulted in the demotion of Konyaspor, who joined Kocaelispor and Hacettepe on their way to the second-level First League.\\n\\nFenerbahçe and Galatasaray had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, after Sivasspor came in as runners-up and Trabzonspor finished third. The final positions for the three Istanbul clubs marked the first time since the 1980–81 season that only one of them was able to finish among the top three teams in Turkish football.\\n\\nPromotion and relegation from 2007–08\\nÇaykur Rizespor, Manisaspor and Kasımpaşa were relegated at the end of the 2007–08 season after finishing on the bottom three places of the standings. They were replaced by TFF First League champions Kocaelispor, runners-up Antalyaspor and play-off winners Eskişehirspor.\\n\\nTeam overview\\n\\nNotes\\n Kayserispor played their 2008 home matches at Kayseri Atatürk Stadium.

It is a key maritime institution under the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China, and is a Chinese state Double First Class University Plan university identified by the Ministry of Education.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe long history of the university can be traced back to 1909, when the Nanyang Institute in Shanghai established a Shipping Management Section.  DMU was founded in 1953 through the merger of three merchant marine institutions: Shanghai Nautical College, the Northeast Navigation College and Fujian Navigation School. At the time its name was Dalian Marine College, and it was the only maritime college in China. In 1960, DMU was designated a national key institution of higher education. Later in 1983, the Asia-Pacific Region Maritime Training Center was established at DMU by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the IMO, and in 1985, a branch of the World Maritime University (WMU) was established.\\n\\nIn 1994 the university's name was changed to the present one.\\n\\nOn June 6, 2009, DMU celebrated its centennial, with vice chairman of standing committee of 11th National People's Congress Chen Zhili as the main guest.\\n\\nFacilities \\nDMU is located in southwestern Dalian.

Methodist minister, who for a period supervised Wesleyan missionaries in the Madras Presidency of the British Raj.\\n\\nLife\\nHe was born at St. Austell, Cornwall, on 31 July 1794; his father, Timothy Crowther, and his uncles Jonathan Crowther (1760–1824) and Richard, were Methodist preachers appointed by John Wesley. He was educated at Kingswood School, then in Gloucestershire, and began to preach aged about 20.\\n\\nHaving been principal teacher at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford, Yorkshire, Crowther was appointed in 1823 headmaster of Kingswood School. He was removed from his position there in 1826, because of a brutal use of corporal punishment. One of his pupils was Christopher Walton. After this he was moved between Wesleyan circuits.\\n\\nIn 1837 Crowther was appointed general superintendent of the Wesleyan missions in India, returning to England in 1843 in poor health, where he was again employed in the home ministry. In 1849 he received the appointment of classical tutor in the Wesleyan Theological Institution at Manchester, in Lancashire.\\n\\nAs a scholar, Crowther had a knowledge of Hebrew and several modern languages. He acted as examiner at Wesley College, Sheffield, as well as at the New Kingswood and Woodhouse Grove schools, and wrote for Wesleyan periodicals. His health failed some time before his death, and on 31 December 1855 he was seized with \"congestion of the brain\" while on a visit to the Rev. William Willan in Leeds. In this friend's house he died on 16 January 1856, leaving a widow and family.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nExternal links\\nAttribution\\n\\n1794 births\\n1856 deaths\\nEnglish Methodist ministers\\nPeople from St Austell\\n19th-century Methodist ministers   \n",
       "4    The doctrine of priest–penitent privilege does not apply in England. However, before the Reformation, England was a Roman Catholic country and the Seal of the Confessional had great authority in the English courts.\\n\\nAnglo-Saxon England\\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there several laws concerning confession. The laws of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, enjoin:\\n\\nThis injunction is repeated in the forty-fourth of the secular laws of King Canute. These laws are prefaced thus: \"This then is the secular law which by the counsel of my witan I will that it be observed all over England\".\\n\\nThe laws of King Ethelred the Unready declare (V, 22):\\n\\nThe very close connexion between the religion of the Anglo-Saxons and their laws, many of which are purely ordinances of religious observance enacted by the state, the repeated recognition of the supreme jurisdiction of the Pope, and the various instances of the application in the Church in England of the laws of the Church in general lead to the opinion that the ecclesiastical law of the secrecy of confession was recognized by the law of the land in Anglo-Saxon England.\\n\\nAfter the Norman Conquest\\nIn the period between the Norman Conquest and the Reformation the law of the Church in general, as to the inviolability of the seal of confession, is stringently enjoined by English councils. The Council of Raleigh (1220) declared as follows:\\n\\nThe Provincial Council of Oxford, held in 1222, contains a similar canon, in which degradation is prescribed for any breach of the seal. The law, as laid down by the 21st canon of the Lateran Council, is also declared in the Acts of the Synod of Exeter in 1287 (Spelman, Concilia, II, 357).\\n\\nThe fact that the laws of the Church were so emphatic on the subject, coupled with the fact that the Church was then the Church of the nation, affords good ground for inferring that the secular courts recognized the seal. The recognition of it would not have rested on any principle of immunity from disclosure of confidential communications made to clergymen. It would have rested on the fact that confession was a sacrament, on the fact of that necessity for it which the doctrine of the Church laid down, on the fact of the practice of it by both king and people, and on the fact that the practice was wholly a matter of spiritual discipline and one, moreover, in regard to which the Church had so definitely declared the law of absolute secrecy.\\n\\nIt is stated by some, among others by the Commissioners appointed to report upon the ecclesiastical courts in their report published in 1883, that the ecclesiastical courts in England did not regard themselves as bound by the rules of canon law framed by the Church outside England, by the various papal decrees, rescripts etc. But the Commissioners add that these courts paid great respect and attention to these rules, decrees etc. There seems to be so much weighty evidence against this view that it is difficult to accept it. Sir Frederick Pollock and Professor Frederic William Maitland in their joint History of English Law (I, 94 and 95) say that the jus commune or common law of the universal Church was the law of the Church in England. In this connexion important material is contained in the Provinciale of William Lyndwood (Oxford, 1679), arguably the only great English canonist.\\n\\nThe Provinciale\\nThe Provinciale consists of the provincial constitutions of fourteen Archbishops of Canterbury from Stephen Langton (d. 1228) to Henry Chichele (d. 1443). When Lyndwood was engaged on this compilation he was the principal official of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been, also, the prolocutor of the clergy in the Convocation of Canterbury.\\n\\nMaitland, in his essays on Roman Canon Law in the Church of England, expresses the opinion that the ecclesiastical courts in England regarded the general body of canon law, including the various papal decrees and rescripts and the commentaries of the various great writers, as their law, which they had to administer. In citing Lyndwood as providing grounds for this opinion Maitland says: \"At any rate he will state the law which he administers in the chief of all the English ecclesiastical courts\".\\n\\nIn the Provinciale there is a constitution of \"Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury\", apparently Walter Reynolds, transferred from the See of Worcester in 1313. The constitution begins with a prohibition to priests who have fallen into mortal sin to say mass without first going to confession and warning them against imagining, as some believers erroneously do, that mortal sins are forgiven by the general confession made in the recitation of the Confiteor. It continues as follows:\\n\\nLyndwood on confession\\nLyndwood gives the following commentary on  Walter Reynolds' constitution,  occurring upon the word \"Confession\":\\n\\nDealing with the priest's being found guilty of revealing a confession, he says:\\n\\nHe states that Henry de Bohic:\\n\\nLyndwood then continues as follows:\\n\\nUpon the word \"generaliter\" there is the following comment:\\n\\nHe cites Hostiensis in support. It is to be observed that there is nowhere an exception in respect of the crime of treason. His commentary on the duty of not disclosing the confession of a crime proposed to be committed tends to show that he would not have recognized any such exception.\\n\\nPupilla oculi\\nA manual, called Pupilla oculi (see Gasquet, Pre-Reformation Essays), which appears to have been mainly designed for practical use among the clergy, was compiled towards the end of the fourteenth century by John de Burgh, a professor of theology and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. According to Edward Badeley who wrote in 1865 a most able pamphlet on the privilege of the seal of confession entitled The Privilege of Religious Confessions in English Courts of Justice, this manual, to which Maitland also refers, enjoyed great popularity. Its counsels to confessors who may happen to be witnesses in a court of justice are sufficiently like those already cited from Lyndwood's Provinciale to render it unnecessary to quote them.\\n\\nAnalysis from the Catholic Encyclopedia\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia provides the following analysis:\\n\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia goes on to quote Maitland on what it regards as \"remarkable evidence of the acceptance of the decrees of the Council of Lateran in England\". Speaking of trial by ordeal he says:\\n\\nThe order, thereupon, proceeds to suggest certain rules for the judges to follow.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nAttribution\\n\\nCanon law history\\nHistory of Catholicism in England\\nLegal history of England\\nPriest–penitent privilege in England\\nMedieval English law\\nChristianity in medieval England   \n",

                                     Xtreme Swing is a thrill ride located at Valleyfair in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\\n\\nSpecifications \\nXtreme Swing is a Screamin' Swing type ride built by S&S Worldwide.  The structure itself is  tall at its highest point, the equivalent height of a ten-story building, making it the world's second largest swinging thrill ride, Skyhawk at Cedar Point being the largest. It consists of two swinging arms, both  tall, seating 20 across and 20 back to back (40 total). At full swing, the ends of the arms approach  high off the ground—as high as a twelve-story building—and achieve a maximum velocity of 60 miles-per-hour—faster than most wooden roller coasters.

It has one basement and two storeys. Above the entrance is a relief of the coat of arms of the Hacke and Sturmfeder alliance.\\n\\nThe gable above the front entrance shows a relief, the date 1766 and the names or the arms of alliance of its first owners, Franz Karl Joseph von Hacke (son of Ludwig Anton von Hacke) and Amöna Marie Charlotte Juliane Sturmfeder von Oppenweiler, who was a daughter of local Dirmstein nobleman, Marsilius Franz Sturmfeder von Oppenweiler.\\n\\nIn 1767, an underground water supply was built at the Quellbachhübel, northeast of the residential buildings. It consisted of a spring chamber, in which the water from various springs collected, and three accessible galleries into which the water was directed downwards at a slight gradient to the castle well or to two other wells in the residential area. The latter two, the \"Upper Well\" and the \"Deer Well\", were destroyed after 1965, the tunnel to the castle well, which has been preserved over a length of 300 m, is now called the \"Well Tunnel\" and is one of the cultural monuments of the municipality.\\n\\nHistory \\nThe house was built in 1767 by the architect, Sigmund Jacob Haeckher, and called Maison de la Campagne (\"Country House\"). Its owner was Franz Karl Freiherr von Hacke and his wife, Amönia Freiin von Sturmfeder. He was the master hunter (Obristjägermeister) of Electoral Palatine, responsible for hunting in the 55 km2 Barony of Wilenstein. The first lightning conductor in the Palatinate was installed at the house on 17 April 1776 by physicist, Johann Jakob Hemmer, from Mannheim. Its French garden was planned and executed around 1780 by landscape architect, Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who was also responsible for its natural extension, the attractive valley of Karlstal through which the Moosalb stream flows.\\n\\nFrench Revolutionary troops partly destroyed the house on 13 July 1794, leaving only the cellars inhabitable. The house went into Alsatian possession in 1803. The entire manorial estate of Trippstadt, including the house, was sold in 1833 by Reichsrat, Ludwig von Gienanth.\\n\\nIn 1865, the Freiherr von Gienanth sold the house to the Kingdom of Bavaria. They established a state forestry office there in 1885 and, in 1888, rebuilt the ruined part of the house. A forestry school was opened in the house. In 1915, during the First World War, the school had to be closed. Not until 1946, after the Second World War, was it re-opened as a school of forestry for the Palatinate.\\n\\nThe house was home to the Rhineland-Palatinate State School of Forestry from 1960 to 1980. In 1985, the municipality of Trippstadt took over the management of the gardens and turned them into a recreation area. In 1987, the house became the home of the Forest Research Institute of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nLiterature \\n Günter Stein: Burgen und Schlösser in der Pfalz.

  Gananoque Airport  is located  northwest of the town of Gananoque, Ontario, Canada, in Canada's busy Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. It is currently a major centre for skydiving, as well as one of the three Canadian airports serving the Thousand Islands (along with Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport and Brockville Regional Tackaberry Airport).\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Kingston Airport was a relief landing field for RCAF Station Kingston (now Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport) during World War II, and with Kingston, participated in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The field preserves the original, classic BCATP triangular runway arrangement along with some of the original wartime structures.\\n\\nSince 1971, the airport has been utilized as a sports skydiving dropzone with jumps available to the general public.\\n\\nSee also\\n Gananoque Water Aerodrome\\n RCAF Detachment Gananoque\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Page about this airport on COPA's Places to Fly airport directory\\n Skydive Gananoque\\n\\nRegistered aerodromes in Ontario\\nAirports of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan   \n",
